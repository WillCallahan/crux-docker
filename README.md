# Crux Docker

Project to start running [Crux] on docker in AWS ECS.

The Crux-Docker project provides a template with two key goals; a main function capable of running Crux in a
production environment and a container to host the Crux service.

## Pre-Conditions

This library assumes that you have an AWS account that follows best practices for infrastructure. That being said, you
are expected to have isolated CloudFormation stacks that each have dedicated purposes. 

The host AWS account must have access to a Kafka cluster as the Kafka cluster will act as the primary data store for
data indexed by Crux.

## Issues

Feel free to submit issues at any time! Please include steps to reproduce any issue you encounter.

You may also use issues to submit questions. Questions will result in more detailed documentation.

## Configuration

### AWS Configuration

#### Security Groups

The Crux service expects that a Kafka service is running. Either the AWS Managed Service for Kafka (MSK) or a manual
service of Kafka can be used as the data store for Crux. In order for the Crux service to connect to Kafka, you should
grant access to the `crux-host-<stack-name>` security group on ports `2181` and `9092`.

Access to the Crux service is restricted using the `crux-client-<stack-name>`. Add the `crux-client-<stack-name>`
security group to any service that should be able to connect to Crux. By default, clients should connect to the Crux
service using port `3000`.
